Hello, Peter!

These tasks require the calculation of the longest route in some form . (AOC day 16,17,21,23)
Perhaps the cleanest version is the second part of day 23, where you have to find the longest route on a board with obstacles - simplifying the task.

I know that the code I wrote is quite unreadable, and the name : findShortestPath is left like that in many places, it's just because I used a function with that name as a base, which I didn't fix afterwards. (Sorry, I didn't think I would show the code to someone :disappointed: )

On day 17, there is a python code that I copied from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pDSooPLLkI&t=395s . I couldn't understand the logic, I didn't have a problem with python, although I can't code in that language.

Thank you for helping me understand the solution to this problem. I don't know if I'll ever need it in my work, but for now I'm glad to have someone to ask.

Yours faithfully,
Ildi
